# Placement+

A fork of https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/accurate-block-placement-reforged.
- Removes the bedrock bridging feature as quark already has it
- Makes it toggleable with a keybind (like the original before being reforged, but with my own implementation because the original's github repo is gone)

- Doesn't clean up the code :(
